        <div className="studio-content">
          <p>Welcome to Sacred Spiral Studios. Here we support up and coming artists in getting their feet in doors and their art in front of an audience.</p>
          
          <p>2025 is shaping up to be a big year for us. Currently in the works is a brand new platform for artists and venues to connect. We're calling it <strong>The Connection</strong>, the goal being to provide a more streamlined and accessible way for artists to find gigs and bookers to review content. Artists may create profiles that showcase their work and bookers can create profiles that help promote their venue and reach a broader range of artists. <strong>The Connection</strong> will not be limited to musical acts and venues. We will offer a platform for all types of artists and all types of venues. Stay tuned.</p>
          
          <p>We are also making our way out into the real world in the form of vender fairs and more in-person events. Sacred Spiral Studios now proudly serves as the Booking and Events Manager for <a href="https://www.monkeynestcoffee.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Monkey Nest Coffee</a>. For all booking inquiries, please head to our <Link to="/contact">contact page</Link>.</p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>For many artists it can be hard managing self promotion on top of their daily lives. This new world of social media promotion has created such a large pool of creative talent it can be almost impossible to stay afloat, much less get noticed. However, one tried and true method of self promotion remains intact. The old school "social networking" habit of people coming together around creative ideas and activities is still one of the most effective ways to promote yourself as an artist, new and old. At Sacred Spiral Studios, we are aiming to promote, host, and partake in the physical/tangible world of artists and creatives. Our plan to expand into more "live" settings is motivated by our love for word-of-mouth promotion. This collective started in that exact way, and we believe your next project can too.</p>
